Amazon explains that “T2 instances’ baseline performance and ability to burst are governed by CPU Credits. Each T2 instance receives CPU Credits continuously, the rate of which depends on the instance size. T2 instances accrue CPU Credits when they are idle, and use CPU Credits when they are active. A CPU Credit provides the performance of a full CPU core for one minute.” So the instance is constantly “fed” CPU Credits, and consumes them when the CPU is active. If the rate of consumption is less than the rate of feeding, the CPUCreditBalance (a metric visible in CloudWatch) will increase. Otherwise it will decrease (or stay the same).
