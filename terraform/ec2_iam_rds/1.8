When you hibernate an instance, Amazon EC2 signals the operating system to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk). Hibernation saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to your Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) root volume. Amazon EC2 persists the instance's EBS root volume and any attached EBS data volumes. When you start your instance:

The EBS root volume is restored to its previous state

The RAM contents are reloaded

The processes that were previously running on the instance are resumed

Previously attached data volumes are reattached and the instance retains its instance ID
