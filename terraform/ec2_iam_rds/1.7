looking at a T2.medium, Amazon says it has a baseline allocation of 40% of one vCPU, and earns Credits at the rate of 24 per hour (each credit representing one vCPU running at 100% for one minute; so earning 24 Credits per hour allows you to run the instance at the baseline of 40% of one vCPU). This allocation is spread across the two cores of the T2.medium instance.
