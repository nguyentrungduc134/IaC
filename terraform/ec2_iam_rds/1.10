When creating an AWS IAM User Login Profile using Terraform, the initial password is returned in the response from AWS. This is a security risk as anyone with access to your Terraform state file can see this password. To mitigate this risk, Terraform allows you to provide a PGP key. The initial password is then encrypted using this key and you must use the corresponding private key to decrypt it
