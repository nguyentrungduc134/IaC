#terraform_remote_state is terraform data source that take output of other resource state
data.terraform_remote_state.<NAME>.outputs.<ATTRIBUTE>
#There are a number of other built-in functions that you can use to manipulate
strings, numbers, lists, and maps. One of them is the file function:
file(<PATH>)
file reads a file from disk and returns its literal contents without any template interpretation.
file("user-data.sh")
#The catch is that the User Data script for the web server cluster needs some
dynamic data from Terraform, including the server port, database address, and
database port. When the User Data script was embedded in the Terraform code,
you used Terraform references and interpolation to fill in these values. This does
not work with the file function.
templatefile is a function read file (bash script) and use variable to create template
templatefile(path, vars)
For Terraform 0.12 and later, the template_file data source has been superseded by the templatefile function,
#rendered attribute: result of template
user_data = data.template_file.user_data.rendered
