#These outputs(DB address, port) are now also stored in the Terraform state for the database, which
is in your S3 bucket at the path terraform.tfstate. You
can get the web server cluster code to read the data from this state file by adding
the terraform_remote_state data source in webservercluster/main.tf:
data "terraform_remote_state" "db" 
This terraform_remote_state data source configures the web server cluster
code to read the state file from the same S3 bucket and folder where the database
stores its state,
#All of the databaseâ€™s output variables are stored in the state file and you can read
them from the terraform_remote_state data source using an attribute
reference of the form:
data.terraform_remote_state.<NAME>.outputs.<ATTRIBUTE>i
#Terraform includes a number of built-in functions that you can execute using an
expression of the form:
function_name(...)
#When the User Data script was embedded in the Terraform code,
you used Terraform references and interpolation to fill in these values. This does
not work with the file function. However, it does work if you use a
template_file data source.
#The final step is to update the user_data parameter of the
aws_launch_configuration resource to point to the rendered output attribute
of the template_file data source:
