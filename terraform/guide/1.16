Each Terraform configuration has an associated backend that defines how Terraform executes operations and where Terraform stores persistent data, like state.
The persistent data stored in the backend belongs to a workspace. The backend initially has only one workspace containing one Terraform state associated 
with that configuration. Some backends support multiple named workspaces, allowing multiple states to be associated with a single configuration.
 The configuration still has only one backend, but you can deploy multiple
 distinct instances of that configuration without configuring a new backend or changing authentication credentials.
 Terraform starts with a single, default workspace named default that you cannot delete. If you have not created a new workspace, you are using the default workspace in your Terraform working directory.
#When you run terraform plan in a new workspace, Terraform does not access existing resources in other workspaces.
 These resources still physically exist, but you must switch workspaces to manage them.
 Within your Terraform configuration, you may include the name of the current workspace using the ${terraform.workspace} interpolation sequence. 
 This can be used anywhere interpolations are allowed.
Referencing the current workspace is useful for changing behavior based on the workspace. 
For example, for non-default workspaces, it may be useful to spin up smaller cluster sizes
