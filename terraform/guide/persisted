 Most non-trivial Terraform configurations either integrate with Terraform Cloud or use a backend to store state remotely.
 This lets multiple people access the state data and work together on that collection of infrastructure resources.
This page describes how to configure a backend by adding the backend block to your configuration.
By default, Terraform uses a backend called local, which stores state as a local file on disk. 
You can also configure one of the built-in backends included in this documentation.
Some of these backends act like plain remote disks for state files, while others support locking the state while operations are being performed.
 This helps prevent conflicts and inconsistencies. The built-in backends listed are the only backends. 
 You cannot load additional backends as plugins.
 associated with your configuration. If your configuration includes a cloud block, it cannot include a backend block.
To configure a backend, add a nested backend block within the top-level terraform block. The following example configures the remote backend.
A configuration can only provide one backend block.
A backend block cannot refer to named values (like input variables, locals, or data source attributes).
