When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates instances, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones that are used by your Auto Scaling group. Maintaining balance across Availability Zones takes precedence over termination policies. If one Availability Zone has more instances than the other Availability Zones that are used by the group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling applies the termination policies to the instances from the imbalanced Availability Zone. If the Availability Zones used by the group are balanced, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling applies the termination policies across all of the Availability Zones for the group.
