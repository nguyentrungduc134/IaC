You can use an instance refresh to update the instances in your Auto Scaling group instead of manually replacing instances a few at a time. This can be useful when a configuration change requires you to replace instances, and you have a large number of instances in your Auto Scaling group.

An instance refresh can be helpful when you have a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or a new user data script. To use an instance refresh, first create a new launch template that specifies the new AMI or user data script. Then, start an instance refresh to begin updating the instances in the group immediately.
