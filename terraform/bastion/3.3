When you attach an Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Gateway Load Balancer, you attach a target group. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling adds instances to the attached target group when they are launched. You can attach one or multiple target groups, and configure health checks on a per target group basis.
