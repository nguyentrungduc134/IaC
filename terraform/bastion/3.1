When an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling health check determines that an InService instance is unhealthy, it terminates the instance and launches a new replacement instance. The health check grace period specifies the minimum amount of time (in seconds) to keep a new instance in service before terminating it if it's found to be unhealthy.
