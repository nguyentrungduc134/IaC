Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling starts performing a rolling replacement of the instances. It takes a set of instances out of service, terminates them, and launches a set of instances with the new desired configuration. Then, it waits until the instances pass your health checks and complete warmup before it moves on to replacing other instances.

After a certain percentage of the group is replaced, a checkpoint is reached. Whenever there is a checkpoint, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling temporarily stops replacing instances and sends a notification. Then, it waits for the amount of time you specified before continuing. After you receive the notification, you can verify that your new instances are working as expected.

After the instance refresh succeeds, the Auto Scaling group settings are automatically updated with the launch template that you specified at the start of the operation.
